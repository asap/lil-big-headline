# lil-big-headline
Shrinks down a preview headline for editors

For those who are implementing special cases for rendering headlines or other content, but don't want to make any changes in their CMS (for reasons), you can use this Chrome plugin to fake it.

Created as an example of a quick and dirty Chrome plugin, but can be usesful for a quick, one day preview. In my case, it was used for a custom rendering "hack" for election day.
